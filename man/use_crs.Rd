\usage{
use_crs(crs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{crs}{"string": Which crs to return? See the "Options" section below
for a list of available projections. If none of those names are matched,
the string will be fed in as is, and assumed to be an alternative valid
crs definition. Defaults to match whichever RCM data was listed first
in the ".Rprofile" file (matches using the dataset's 'src').}
}
\description{
RCM projections do not have standard EPSG codes, and usually
work on a rotated grid. This function returns the correct proj4 string
for the RACMO or MAR data in Antarctica. A couple of other common
projections for use in Antarctica are also available. These projection
definitions are stored in \code{.polarEnv$crs}, which is configured by
}
\section{Projections}{
\subsection{RACMO}{

The RACMO projections are taken directly from their respective NetCDFs.
These can be viewed with a command such as
\code{ncdf4::ncatt_get(nc, "rotated_pole")}.
}

\subsection{MAR}{

The default MAR crs is based on EPSG:3031 (taken from the description of
this \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2547638}{Zenodo dataset}, but it
appears that it is in kilometres, not metres as a standard EPSG:3031
would be. This is very much to be finished off with the correct datasets!

\subsection{Projection Options}{

Options are:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{  - "racmo"             Antarctic wide
  - "racmoAA"           Antarctic wide (as above, just more explicit!)
  - "racmoAP"           Antarctic Peninsula
  - "mar"               Who knows at the moment?!
  - "stereo"            Antarctic Polar Stereographic EPSG:[3031](https://epsg.io/3031)
  - "lambertEqual"      Lambert Equal Area Equidistant (EPSG: [102020](https://epsg.io/102020))
  - "ortho"             Orthographic South Pole (EPSG: [102037](https://epsg.io/102037))
  - "WGS84" / "ERA5"    WGS84 GPS System (EPSG: [4326](https://epsg.io/4326))
  - "stereoAus"         Australian Antarctic Polar Stereographic (EPSG: [3032](https://epsg.io/3032))
  - "lambertAus"        Australian Antarctic Lambert (EPSG: [3033](https://epsg.io/3033))
  - "ease2"             NSIDC EASE-Grid 2.0 South (EPSG: [6932](https://epsg.io.6932))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

These crs definitions are stored in \code{.polarEnv$grids$crs}.

pages are particularly good for showing the extent where the projection
has been created for.
