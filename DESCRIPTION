Description: polaR is a personal package for interacting with and manipulating 
    output from the RACMO and MAR regional climate models. The package is an 
    ongoing work in progress, is not foolproof, and is essentially a lot of 
    data wrangling to accommodate different RCM datasets, and syntactic wrapping 
    around the `terra` package to ease repeated processes.
