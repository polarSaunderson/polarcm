Description: `polarcm` is a personal package for interacting with and 
    manipulating output from the polar regional climate models (RCMs) RACMO and 
    MAR. It has mainly been developed with RACMO2.3p3 and is currently being 
    expanded to handle other RACMO versions and MAR data. The package is an 
    ongoing work-in-progress that eases repeated processes, but should be 
    treated with caution as it is developed. It relies heavily on the `terra`
    package, and another personal package I am developing, called `terrapin`. 
    Version 0.1.3-rc1.
