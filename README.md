# racmoR

## Overview
racmoR is a personal package for interacting with and manipulating output from the RACMO regional climate model.
The package is an ongoing work in progress, is not foolproof, and is essentially a lot of syntactic wrapping around the [terra](https://rspatial.org) package to ease repeated processes.

It is necessary to separately download the RACMO data. 
The RACMO2.3p3 data that this package was initially created to handle can be accessed online at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7639053] and was created by Christiaan van Dalum at IMAU, Utrecht University.
